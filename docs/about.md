# About

`pybhpt` is a collection of numerical tools for analyzing perturbations of Kerr spacetime, particularly the self-forces and metric-perturbations experienced by small bodies moving in a Kerr background.

## Subpackages
- `pybhpt.geodesic`: generates bound timelike geodesics in Kerr spacetime
- `pybhpt.radial`: calculates homogeneous solutions of the radial Teukolsky equation
- `pybhpt.swsh`: constructs the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics
- `pybhpt.teuk`: evaluates inhomogeneous solutions (Teukolsky amplitudes) of the radial Teukolsky equation due to a point-particle on a bound timelike Kerr geodesic
- `pybhpt.flux`: produces gravitational wave fluxes sourced by a point-particle on a generic bound timelike Kerr geodesic
- `pybhpt.hertz`: solves for the Hertz potentials for the CCK and AAB metric reconstruction procedures
- `pybhpt.metric`: produces coefficients needed to reconstruct the metric from the Hertz potentials
- `pybhpt.redshift`: computes the generalized Detweiler redshift invariant in a variety of gauges
