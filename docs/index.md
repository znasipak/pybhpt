# Welcome to pybhpt's documentation

`pybhpt` is a collection of numerical tools for analyzing perturbations of Kerr spacetime, particularly the self-forces and metric-perturbations experienced by small bodies moving in a Kerr background.

## Subpackages
- [`pybhpt.geo`](pybhpt.geo): generates bound periodic timelike geodesics in Kerr spacetime
- [`pybhpt.radial`](pybhpt.radial): calculates homogeneous solutions of the radial Teukolsky equation
- [`pybhpt.swsh`](pybhpt.swsh): constructs the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics
- [`pybhpt.teuk`](pybhpt.teuk): evaluates inhomogeneous solutions (Teukolsky amplitudes) of the radial Teukolsky equation due to a point-particle on a bound timelike Kerr geodesic
- [`pybhpt.flux`](pybhpt.flux): produces gravitational wave fluxes sourced by a point-particle on a generic bound timelike Kerr geodesic
- [`pybhpt.hertz`](pybhpt.hertz): solves for the Hertz potentials for the CCK and AAB metric reconstruction procedures
- [`pybhpt.metric`](pybhpt.metric): produces coefficients needed to reconstruct the metric from the Hertz potentials
- [`pybhpt.redshift`](pybhpt.redshift): computes the generalized Detweiler redshift invariant in a variety of gauges
