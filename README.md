# pybhpt

A python package for solving problems in black hole perturbation theory

`pybhpt` is a collection of numerical tools for analyzing perturbations of Kerr spacetime, particularly the self-forces experienced by small bodies moving in a Kerr background. Subpackages include: 

- `pybhpt.geodesic`: a module that generates bound timelike geodesics in Kerr spacetime
- `pybhpt.radial`: a module that calculates homogeneous solutions of the radial Teukolsky equation
- `pybhpt.swsh`: a module that constructs the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics
- `pybhpt.teuk`: a module that evaluates the inhomogeneous solutions (Teukolsky amplitudes) of the radial Teukolsky equation due to a point-particle on a bound timelike Kerr geodesic
- `pybhpt.flux`: a module that produces the gravitational wave fluxes sourced by a point-particle on a generic bound timelike Kerr geodesic
- `pybhpt.hertz`: a module that solves for the Hertz potentials for the CCK and AAB metric reconstruction procedures
- `pybhpt.metric`: a module that produces the coefficients needed to reconstruct the metric from the Hertz potentials
- `pybhpt.redshift`: a module that computes the generalized Detweiler redshift invariant in a variety of gauges

## Installation

PyBHPT relies on several dependencies to install and run, namely a C/C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`), `gsl`, `boost`, `Cython`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `python >= 3.7`.
To reduce package conflicts and ensure that the proper dependencies are installed,
we recommend using Anaconda and its virtual environments.

Create a conda environment `pybhpt-env` (or whatever name you would like)
with the necessary dependencies to install `pybhpt`:
```
conda create -n pybhpt-env -c conda-forge gsl boost-cpp Cython numpy scipy python=3.7
conda activate pybhpt-env
```
To include the necessary compiler on MACOSX Intel run:
```
conda install clang_osx-64 clangxx_osx-64
```
To include the necessary compiler on MACOSX silicon run:
```
conda install clang_osx-arm64 clangxx_osx-arm64
```
To include the necessary compiler on linux run:
```
conda install gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64
```
Next clone the `pybhpt` repository from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/znasipak/pybhpt.git
cd pybhpt
```
Finally, we recommend installing the package via `pip`:
```
pip install .
```

## Conda Environments with Jupyter

To run the code in a Jupyter notebook, we recommend `pip` installing the following dependencies:
```
pip install ipykernel matplotlib
```
One can then make the environment accessible within Jupyter by running
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=pybhpt-env
```

## Uninstalling

If the package is installed using `pip`, then one can easily uninstall the package by executing
```
pip uninstall pybhpt
```
To clean the repository, one will also need to remove the directories `build/` and `pybhpt.egg.info/` from the main repository
